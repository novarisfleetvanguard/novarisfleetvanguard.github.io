/**
 * Types for the `logic.js` contract — the six exports the room calls.
 *
 * `logic.js` stays plain JavaScript on purpose: it is the file a game author (or
 * an agent) rewrites, it must contain no imports and no timers, and keeping it
 * dependency- and syntax-light means it can be swapped wholesale without a build
 * step in the loop. This declaration file is what gives it type-checking anyway.
 *
 * Every function must be PURE: same inputs → same outputs, no `Date.now()`, no
 * `Math.random()`, no I/O. The room persists whatever `setup`/`applyAction`
 * return, so state must be JSON-serializable.
